    <h4>Oliver, the angry orange cat, drove aimlessly through the rain, his loneliness gnawing at him. The empty roads blurred by, but no amount of speed could outrun his sadness. </h4>
   <h4>He stopped on a bridge, staring into the dark, swirling river below. In that quiet moment, the anger that had fueled him faded, leaving only the weight of his solitude. </h4>
   <h4>He turned off the engine, and as the rain poured down, he finally let his tears fall.</h4>
